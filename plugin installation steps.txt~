(assuming catkin_ws has already been created)
NOTE: this plugin is best implemented alongside standard magicc
packages for running ros_plane due to its dependency on topic
protocols such as fcu_common, etc.

1. clone ground_station repository folder inside the workspace's src folder
2. build with catkin
3. source devel/setup.bash
4. run roscore
5. run the command "rosrun ground_station ground_station

****
From then on, the plugin will be available by running "roscore", 
sourcing devel/setup.bash, running "rqt" and searching under 
	plugins -> AUVSI -> AUVSI Ground Station

* to avoid the sourcing step, you may just want to add that command
  to the end of your ~/.bashrc file
****

(put these instructions, along with a general program structure /
 ground station guide, into the repository wiki)
